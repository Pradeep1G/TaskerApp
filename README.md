# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is a fullstack website using Vite + React.js as Frontend and Flask(Python) as Backend Server and MongoDB as Database. 
Backened is also deployed in my github account. click the link to see the repository https://github.com/Pradeep1G/TaskServer. 
This project is about to store the users Events in three different categories - ToDo, Doing and Done. 
Easily we can update and remove events from any category and change category of an event by dragging them to other category. 
We can also change colour theme of the web page. 
And also we can add as many as workspaces.
